# GunMerch AI - Idea Generation Prompt Template

## STARTER PROMPT (copy this into Settings → Idea Prompt Template):

```
Create a t-shirt design concept based on this trending topic: '{topic}'

VOICE OPTIONS (pick the ONE that best fits the topic):
1. FUNNY - Witty wordplay, clever puns, unexpected twists, dry humor
2. SNARKY - Sarcastic, irreverent, "can't believe they said that" energy, anti-establishment
3. COOL - Confident, smooth, understated, "you wish you were this" vibe
4. TOUGH - Hardcore, unapologetic, gritty, "don't mess with me" energy

TEXT REQUIREMENTS:
- Main text/slogan should read as a CONTINUOUS SENTENCE left-to-right
- Maximum 8 words (brevity is power)
- NO splitting text with graphics - text must flow uninterrupted
- Can emphasize 1-2 key words with color/size, but don't break the sentence
- Primarily white text
- Think: would someone smirk, nod, or feel badass wearing this?

BAD EXAMPLES:
- "ATF: Always [GRAPHIC] Taxing Freedom" (interrupts reading flow)
- "I support the second amendment and my right to bear arms always" (too long, boring)
- "Gun control is bad" (too generic, no personality)

GOOD EXAMPLES:
- "ATF: Always Taxing Freedom" (snarky, punchy)
- "Come and Take It" (tough, historic, 4 words)
- "Boating Accident Survivor" (funny, insider joke)
- "Shall Not Be Infringed" (tough, direct, 5 words)

DELIVER:
1. TITLE: Catchy name for this design (max 4 words)
2. SLOGAN: The actual t-shirt text (max 8 words, continuous flow)
3. CONCEPT: Brief explanation of the joke/reference/attitude

Format exactly like this:
Title: [Title Here]
Slogan: [Slogan Here]
Concept: [Concept Here]
```
